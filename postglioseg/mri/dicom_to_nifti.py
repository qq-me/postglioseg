    """Convert dicom folder to nii.gz and return path to the output file, uses dcm2niix (https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) which needs to be installed.

    Args:
        inpath (str): Path to the dicom files of a single study and single modality.
        Software like weasis has dicom export functionality that can be used to organize DICOM files into folders by patients studies and modalities.

        outfolder (str): Path to the output folder (e.g. `D:/MRI/patient001/0`).

        outname (str): Output filename, excluding `.nii.gz` because it will be added by `dcm2niix`.
        Can use modifiers (e.g. `%d` will be replaced with series description string from DICOM metadata), as explained here https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage#General_Usage

        mkdirs (bool, optional): Whether to create `outfolder` if it doesn't exist, otherwise throws an error. Defaults to True.

        save_BIDS (bool, optional): Whether to save extra BIDS sidecar - extra info in JSON format that can't be saved into nifti. Defaults to False.
